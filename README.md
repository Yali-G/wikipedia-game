🔗 Wikipedia Game

The Wikipedia game is a fun game where a player is given a starting article, e.g. "pear" and click on a hyperlink in the article which will lead them to another article, and so on and so forth, the objective is to click on these hyperlinks until you reach a target article, e.g. Benjamin Franklin. So I would start on the wiki article for "pear" where I would smartly click on the link to the article "United States" and then from there click on the link "Benjamin Franklin" and win the game!
